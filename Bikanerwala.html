            <h2>Tu janta hai Bikanerwala ka maalik kaun hai?</h2>
            <div class="meta">5 minute read / Sept 1, 2024</div>

            <p> I am in the Bikanerwala counter at the Hyd airport -- which post renovation is getting crazy. Like someone married T2 BOM and T3 DEL. There's 3 people in front of me. A family. Mum, a 20 yr old son and an 18 yo daughter </p> 

            <p>They had already bought their food but they were crowded at the counter, spilling over each other
            -- all 3 with a different agenda. Aunty wanted a box of moong dal halwa she had packed from somewhere heated. The guy at the counter was trying to explain to her that it's not something they do but she was a bengali aunty who had been in Hyd for a while, and boy was she pushy. Then finally the guy asked okay madam can you pls confirm if it's not jhoota. She said nahi nahi jhoota leke hum travel karte aap fatafat garam Karo. The son wanted more chole in an empty cup and the daughter was complaining that she ordered rajma but got chole.</p>

            <p>The guy at the counter said, 'Can you pls give back the chole I'll give you rajma and she, visibly puzzled, said but that toh we've eaten. I presume the chole refill her brother was asking for was the wrong rajma replacement. It was the guy at the counter's turn to be puzzled now. He realised this is going to take some time so he looked at me, next in line, with eyes as if to ask 'okay if I take some time, sir?' I looked at the screen at the boarding gate. The Bikanerwala showdown was way more entertaining. Go ahead, I reassuredly nodded. He took a deep breath and started valiantly. The conversation ended with him and his supervisor handing over a box full of rajma with an extra portion of salad. Amazing.</p>

            <p>I finally get to place my order. I'm waiting to get it. Standing at the side. Suddenly aunty shows up again. Says, 'I saw that there's one subzi that's there, can you give it to me'. 'It's not there in the order, ma'am'. The guy says. Aunty says 'no no I just want to taste. You give no'. The guys are just looking at each other. Mind you, the guys are very sweet. People from Bihar and Rajasthan. Chirpy but not in an annoying way. They are clueless. They don't want to be rude. But there are also 8 other people around, and they don't want to set precedent by giving away free gravy (this is not a refill. It just wasn't there in the order). My ops brain is thinking - how does one ever create an SoP for a situation like this? So they start asking each other hoping she gets a hint and goes away because she's holding up a line. But our lady couldn't care. So some head chef looking person shows up. 'Ma'am there's very little and this is a paneer gravy with no paneer. It won't be too nice. He said this feeling like this was the final dialogue. She'll understand after this and leave.</p>

            <p>"But woh toh mujhe pata hai" she says. That's why I asked you to give it to me. You guys won't have any use for it. The guy, now zapped, says 'but how do we give it to you ma'am, our boxes are counted and this can't be billed'. Making another attempt.</p>

            <p>'Arre just give it in a plate', she says, following up with 'you know I know your owners'. Says names of two gentlemen, who I believe are the legit owners because the guys at the counter did recognise them. She goes on to tell how she knows where they live, how they're family friends etc. At the point the enthu guys are not feeling chatty anymore. They scrape out the subzi - which is about 3/4th the portion someone purchases (it doesn't have paneer tho), put it in a box - because they wanted her to feel like her knowing the owner card worked (at least that's what it felt like to mee) and hand it over to her. She leaves, I come to the centre from the sides to receive my food which is now ready and the guys, while packing my box, say, arre main bhi Mukesh Ambani ka naam or pata jaanta hun and looks up at me as if to indicate that I'm also a part of the conversation because I have full context. The first one says toh kya tujhe tel free me chahiye. The second one says nahi, Jio TV chahiye and looks at me for validating his joke while blowing air through a cover to put salad. I don't know what I thought or why I felt the need to say it, but I said, 'arre aise mat bolo aunty abhi aake sari dukaan khareed lengi.' and just when I finished saying that, I could hear, through my left ear, 'Bhaiyaaaa' from a voice that had become very recently familiar. The aunty was standing on my left. I hadn't realised. I couldn't look away because I had to turn to my left to leave. I saw her. She saw me. We both knew what had happened but didn't want to acknowledge saying and hearing said content. An awkward, encouraging smile on her face. A very polite smile on mine. The bikanervala guy helps by asking 'hanji madam'. She says 'arre bhaiya ek plate do. Plane me khaane ke liye chahiye'. </p>

            <p>'Aapne khaana pack karaaya hai madam. Plates not available for that'. Aunty does something remarkable. She tucks her chin, tilts her head slightly and raises her eyes a little, so as to say, 'Really?!" Like clockwork, the plate gets handed over to her.</p>

            <p>She leaves and the guys blame each other for not following rules. I get my parcel. Thank them. They apologise for the delay. I thank them for the entertainment. I turn around and see that my boarding is delayed.</p>

            I decide to just sit there, unpack my parcel and eat my matar kulcha. Thinking mixed thoughts about the incident and how I missed matar kulcha from Delhi. Before I know it I've finished the matar and there's half a kulcha, pickle and salad left. I broke a piece of the kulcha and was going to eat it with pickle, when a guy came with a katori of chole and said, 'Sir, matar toh khatam ho gaye. Thoda chole khaiyega na' I looked behind him at the guys behind the counter. They were looking at me and smiling kindly. 'Achche se Khao, sir' the main guy said. I said thanks to the guy who got the chole, raised a thumbs up to the guys and went back to finishing my half kulcha with the new box of chole, smiling about what had just happened.</p>
